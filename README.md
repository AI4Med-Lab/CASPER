# **CASPER: Cross-modal Alignment of Spatial and single-cell Profiles for Expression Recovery**

This repository contains the implementation of **CASPER**, a cross-attention–based deep learning framework for predicting unmeasured gene expression in spatial transcriptomics (ST) using matched single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data.  
The model learns how spatial spots interact with transcriptional cell-type centroids through a dual-encoder attention mechanism, enabling accurate imputation of missing genes across multiple ST technologies.
